Forum built in Play Framework 2.

Installation
=======

The forum requires Play Framework 2.

A more detailed installation guide can be found on the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com) website.

Once Play Framework has been installed, `fork` the repository onto your local machine. Open up a terminal window and go to the directory that you forked the repository to. Once in the correct folder, run `play clean compile run` to start the program. The Play console should compile the program and print out a ready message. Once the message is printed, type `localhost:9000` into any web browser and the website will popup.

If you want to edit this code in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), run the `play eclipse` command in the repository folder on your local machine. Then import the project into Eclipse.
